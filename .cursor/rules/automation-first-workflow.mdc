# Automation-First Workflow

When implementing operational or infra-related changes:

1. Prefer **versioned automation** over one-off manual actions.
2. For database changes, use **repo migrations + CI/CD execution** before suggesting SQL-editor-only steps.
3. Keep manual steps only as a fallback and document why automation is not possible.
4. Add/extend scripts and workflows when they reduce repeated human effort.
5. Ensure automation is safe:
   - idempotent migrations where possible
   - secret-driven credentials (never hardcoded)
   - explicit failure on missing configuration
