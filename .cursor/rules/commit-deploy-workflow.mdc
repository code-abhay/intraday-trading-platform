# Commit & Deploy Workflow

After completing any code changes (fixes, features, refactors):

1. **TypeScript check**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no type errors
2. **Git commit**: Stage all changes and commit with a descriptive message using HEREDOC format
3. **Git push**: Push to `origin main`
4. **Vercel deploy**: Run `npx vercel --prod` and wait for "Ready" status
5. **Verify**: Confirm the deployment URL shows "Ready" in the output

Always do all 5 steps together. Never leave changes uncommitted or undeployed.

If the build fails on Vercel, fix the error immediately and re-deploy.

## Paper Trade Storage Key

When changing the `PaperTrade` interface, bump the storage key version (e.g. `paper_trades_v3` → `paper_trades_v4`) so old incompatible data doesn't cause issues. Remind the user to "Reset All Trades" after interface changes.
